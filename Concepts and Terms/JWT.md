<h3> What is JWT(Jason web token)? </h3>

JSON Web token is an open standard for securly transmitting information between parties as JSON object.

It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.

<h4> what is Idp(identity provider)</h4>
An Identity Provider (IdP) in the context of JWT is a service that is responsible for issuing and managing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for users who have successfully authenticated with the provider. The IdP is the source of the claims or user information that is encoded into the JWT.

When a user authenticates with an IdP, the provider generates a JWT that contains information about the user, such as their name, email address, and other attributes. The JWT is then sent to the user's browser, where it can be stored in a cookie or local storage.

The user can then include the JWT in subsequent requests to a service or application that requires authentication. The service or application can verify the JWT by checking the signature and decoding the claims to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the requested resource.

There are many different types of Identity Providers, ranging from social login providers like Google and Facebook to enterprise identity solutions like Active Directory and Okta. The choice of IdP will depend on the specific needs of the application or service, as well as the requirements for authentication and user management.

<h4>JWT continue</h4>
A JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature. The header specifies the type of token and the algorithm used to sign it. The payload contains the claims or information about the user, such as their name, email address, or user ID. The signature is created by combining the header, payload, and a secret key, and is used to verify the integrity of the token.

JWTs are typically issued by an authentication server, which generates a token after a user has successfully authenticated. The token can then be sent to the client and included in subsequent requests as a means of verifying the user's identity and access privileges.

One of the benefits of using JWTs is that they are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to maintain a session or keep track of user data. This can make it easier to scale and secure web applications. Additionally, JWTs can be easily decoded and verified, making them a popular choice for modern web applications.
